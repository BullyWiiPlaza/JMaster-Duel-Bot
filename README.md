## Features
The tool's current features are:
- [Botting PvP Ranked/Event Duels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMmEmrLBQoA) (Currently with "Only Pass Turns" and [Nurse Burn botting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZYzdpIKAKI) or [Self Burn botting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ntpO1UPrM) since [D.D. Dynamite botting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5m7cQYdz9w) is  dead due to the ban list).  
**Note:** [This is the best way to earn gems longterm by getting gem drops as well as completing daily and lifetime missions automatically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q_PGikQ3n4)
- [Botting solo duels for XP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJbZtvzDB1Q) (and therefore unlimited lifetime mission gem rewards)  
*Note: It's now recommended to use the "Solo XP Network Bot" instead.*
- [Solo XP Network Bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbN9Vcv_FmM) (Level your account up to level 50 easily and earn gems)
- Starting, quitting, pausing and resuming the game
- [Instant Win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_rI8beVxaM) (Working for solo mode only, as the name implies, basically sets the opponent's LP to 0 so you win the duel immediately)
- [Set your LP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0iOH-x-170) (Compatible with solo only once again, may still be buggy)
- [Force Replay Controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0iOH-x-170) (During duels you can enable replay controls as if you were watching an actual duel replay)
- [Reveal All Cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK-TBbZb8gc) (PvE only, in PvP face-down cards are shown in pink, hence the data isn't available anymore and cannot be used to your advantage)
- [PvP Spectator Mode Reveal Cards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyllepRE-Xg) (Allows a spectator to see all cards in the duel in duel room duels/tournaments including full current deck ordering, extra decks etc.)
- [Speed Hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88L3He5ybjM) (Faster overall gameplay/animations)
- [Card Rarity Mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d24A0XXhGMk) (All cards a certain rarity but it's a visual only mod during duels and does not affect your owned cards)
- [Duel Skipper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34L1Rf_eAB0) (Faster "Instant Win" when used with "Duel Result" set to "Win")
- [Disconnect Duel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynMg10qTHbo)/[Invalidate Losses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTBEoryGAZE) (Avoid losses in ~~PvP~~ solo at any time during the duel by either disconnecting with the "Disconnect Duel" button or enabling "Invalidate Losses". [Still working for PvP to avoid deranks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_WLQ1oUVP4).)
- [~~PvP~~ Solo Surrender Mod [Credits to traumschmuser]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztSCcWuZ3ds) (Force your opponent to surrender so you win instantly)
- Disable PvP Inactivity Surrender (No longer lose automatically for being idle so you could time stall the full timer)
- Disable Unity Crash Reporter (No crash reports sent to Konami): This happens automatically when running the application
- [Play illegal Decks in ~~PvP~~ Solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdcfKqkr1jk) (Forbidden cards and non-owned cards, essentially unlock all cards at 3x and allow playing less than 40 cards in your main deck)
- [Duel Spoofer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CissAo57Y8) (Allows you to build and play any decks you want in solo via the bot's UI completely with no deck building limitations at all and load/save deck profiles in JSON format, MasterDuelMeta.com saved decks can be loaded as well)
- [Duel Spy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqKje6WB5A4) (Allows seeing your entire deck ordering in ~~PvP~~ solo duels)
- ~~[Duel Crasher in PvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xYvQpZjk8Q) (New method to avoid losses from being counted, similar to "Disconnect Duel" but more "tedious" to perform)~~ (the method in the video is patched and the workaround seems to also been patched as of 02/06/2023)
- [Automatic Solo Completion Network Bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVumjKXQp1c) (Allows you to complete the entire solo mode by clicking 1 button and [it only takes a couple minutes for completion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgDKsqDo_rk). This makes creating and selling accounts very efficient!)
- [PvP Deck Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLd6IKV8BS8) (Fully automatically track the amount of cards left in your deck without taking notes, great for high level competitive play!)
- [~~PvP Coin Toss Exploit~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5GqBfVsOPQ) (~~Exit duels without getting losses if you e.g. lose the coin toss~~) (patched as of 04/10/2023 after the server maintenance)
- *... potentially more*

## Donator
Some feature may require Donator status (or even Donator+ status). If you're interested in unlocking all features, check out the `Donator` tab in the application. Thank you for supporting this project. With your contribution, we can make the bot great again™.

### Official Chinese resale version
~~I'm offering an official Chinese resale version of the JMaster Duel Bot. My agent is authorized to sell it on his own using his WeChat QR code. To verify, his WeChat ID is ugfc664**. If you see him around on Chinese websites, you'll know that he's legit. Please only contact him if you paid to him via the donator tab (his name is 111 and he has a funny dog as his profile picture). The non-resale version has a different WeChat payment recipient. You can only get the resale version directly from my agent in order for his referrals to be distinguishable from my own sales. The feature set of the bot is fully identical though.~~  

Currently, my Chinese business partner is no longer available, so his Chinese resale version's Donator of JMaster Duel Bot is also unavailable for purchase. If you're Chinese, you can still buy Donator on the regular version from me.

### 官方中文转售版
~~我提供的是JMaster Duel Bot的中国官方转售版本。我的代理人被授权使用他的微信二维码自行销售。为了验证，他的微信ID是ugfc664**。如果你在中国网站上看到他，你就会知道他是合法的。如果你通过捐赠者标签向他付款，请只与他联系（他的名字是111，他有一只有趣的狗作为他的个人资料图片）。非转售版本有一个不同的微信支付收件人。你只能直接从我的代理人那里获得转售版本，以便他的推荐人与我自己的销售区分开来。不过机器人的功能设置是完全相同的。~~  

目前，我的中国商业伙伴已经不在了，所以他的中文转售版的JMaster Duel Bot的Donator也无法购买了。如果你是中国人，你仍然可以从我这里购买普通版的Donator。
