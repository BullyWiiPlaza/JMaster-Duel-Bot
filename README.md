## Download
Please go to the [GitHub Releases page](../../releases/latest) in order to download the application.

### Anti Virus
If you get an anti virus alert of "trojan" or "trojan.downloader" then it only means that the anti virus detected a downloading/updating functionality. It's harmless since the bot has those built-in to work better and supply you with the latest version automatically. [You might need to allow the launcher in your anti virus settings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26). Feel free to run it in a virtual machine for testing if you don't trust it at first in order to see if it's legit.
